I have integrated SQL and Python to streamline data acquisition, predictive modeling, and database management. Leveraging SQL, I efficiently extracted and prepared data, empowering predictive analytics in Python to forecast outcomes with precision. After generating insights, I seamlessly loaded results back into SQL databases for easy access and further analysis. Harnessing the visualization capabilities of Power BI, I connected with the database to craft intuitive visualizations, uncovering trends and patterns that drive actionable insights and strategic decision-making. This end-to-end approach ensures a comprehensive understanding of data dynamics, enabling informed actions to drive organizational success.
